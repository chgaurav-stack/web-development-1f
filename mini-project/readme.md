# 📝 To-Do List Web App (Local Storage Based)

A simple and interactive **To-Do List Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app uses **Browser Local Storage** to ensure that tasks remain saved even after refreshing or closing the browser.

This project was created as an **End Semester Project** to understand core web development concepts without using any backend or frameworks.

## 📚 What I Learned From This Project

- How to manipulate the **DOM** using JavaScript
- Handling **user events** like clicks and input
- Storing and retrieving data using **Local Storage**
- Converting JavaScript objects to JSON using `JSON.stringify()`
- Parsing JSON data using `JSON.parse()`
- Building a **persistent web application** without backend
- Structuring clean and readable front-end code

## 🧠 Working Principle

- Tasks are stored in the browser using **Local Storage** as a JSON array.
- Whenever a task is added, deleted, or marked as completed, the updated data is saved again.
- On page load, tasks are fetched from Local Storage and displayed on the UI, ensuring persistence.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Edit task functionality
- Task filtering (All / Completed / Pending)
- Clear all tasks button
- Responsive design for mobile devices
